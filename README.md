## About this repository


Our project is about kindergarten management application.

It allows applications to be sorted and searched for by parents according to certain criteria. 
The parent needs to make a registration in order to submit a candidacy.
According to set points for each of the districts of the city, points can be given, which form a score for applying to a kindergarten.
